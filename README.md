# Prework-study-guide

## Description

My motivation to building this prework study guide is to get a basic understanding of everything i need to start strong in the bootcamp.

Building the project taught me how to work with github, terminal, HTML, CSS and Javascript and now feel like I have all the tools to start building further projects.

There were issues that were encountered during the setup of the SSH keys for github but were overcome from researching the errors on Google & trial and error.
